# unblocker thing

made this in study hall cuz im bored. it opens sites in about:blank so maybe the filter doesnt catch it

## how to use
1. open index.html
2. type a website
3. click go
4. it loads inside a blank page

## idk if it works everywhere
- works on my chromebook sometimes
- dont use it if u get in trouble

## theres a weird thing
if u type "rick" or "astley" it opens a microsoft doc with a video  
its not actually a doc its just a video player thing  
no login needed

## made with
- html and js from google
- took like 20 mins
- im tired
